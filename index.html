            This site is the my attempt at the Cloud Resume Challenge project! The main goal was to create an online resume while showcasing the skills I learned on Amazon Web Services. I used a mix of technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, AWS S3 buckets, Pipelines, Dynamo DB, Lambda, and APIs, among others.

            If you're interested in knowing more about the steps involved, feel free to check out my personal blog where I've detailed everything!  <a href="https://notmadeyet">Here!</a></p>
